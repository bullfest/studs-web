	"message": "The digitalization hits more and more industries and the need for a highly educated workforce is ever growing. It can be hard for students to navigate themselves among all the possibilities, in the same way it is hard for companies to find the perfect fit when hiring. The mission of the study trip project is to pair students and companies in a way that most benefits both. During the academic year 2016/2017 the project group will visit companies at events arranged jointly with the company and the project to create a highly qualitative meeting. The events are tailored to meet each individual companies needs, usually the project group is invited to the office of the company during a evening where the students gets a deeper insight into the operations of the company."
